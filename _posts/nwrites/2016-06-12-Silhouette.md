## Silhouette
>
> The bell tolls,\\
  At darkest hour,\\
  The crescent all pearly,\\
  Dispenses ghostly showers,\\
  The Echo persists, lingers & hover,\\
  Crosses my threshold, sounds louder,\\
  Then I get out to greet my horror.
> 
> The moon shines brilliantly,\\
  Clouds tread over him indifferently\\
  Mix shades of white and grey,\\
  Moon dangles from sky's frays,\\
  A mystic creature pondering to flee.
> 
> My path clogs with fog,\\
  Silence pierced by howls of dogs,\\
  The bats glide through wind’s shear,\\
  Night progresses, a hunting black bear.
> 
> Broad avenues seems narrow,\\
  When you are pressed down with sorrow,\\
  Your present couldn't get more hollow,\\
  But if you are tough, you wish,\\
  For light of better tomorrow.
> 
> I am alone, so is the path,\\
  Cold I am, so is the dark,\\
  I have time, the world does not,\\
  The reason I go places,\\
  The world thinks naught.
>
> The wind swivels, a colossal drink,\\
  Nostalgic cold makes me shrink,\\
  The destination will make you cringe,\\
  It's where the death bells ring.
>
> Slowly my senses heighten,\\
  The thought of meeting you, tighten,\\
  A knot in my heart’s strings,\\
  An instrument revives, eager to sing.
>
> And I reach my place,\\
  Heaven for death & decay,\\
  The door croaks as I enter,\\
  Allowing me to go greet her.
>  
> On the grounds are eternal beds,\\
  Crowned by marble stone heads,\\
  But I know the one in which she rests,\\
  For I placed her myself,\\
  With trembling arms and heavy chest.
>
> Swiftly, I make my way,\\
  Sit beside you and say,\\
  Wake up, I am here again today,\\
  Let's complete the life’s play,\\
  I know she wouldn't,\\
  And I am no craze, \\
  But sometimes to better your days,\\
  You part away &and go strange ways.
>  
> I blow off the dust,\\
  From the marble’s crust,\\
  Hot touch against marble’s cold,\\
  I run fingers through ages old,\\
  Engravings, your name, they told.
> 
> Through grooves & through cuts,\\
  I can still feel you as such,\\
  And then a tree trunk swings,\\
  Exposing a form, I could not miss.
>
> Flowing, it would glide,\\
  Illuminated, by a source behind,\\
  I can bet on all roulettes,\\
  I just saw your silhouette.
>
> As it comes to me,\\
  My heart thumps frantically,\\
  As it towers over me,\\
  I am on ground,\\
  Heaving deeply.
>  
> As I open my eyes,\\
  It's just clear starry night,\\
  Twinkling & blinking through their sockets,\\
  Winking, as in hiding this secret in their pockets.
> 
> God or devil,\\
  I don't care for this label,\\
  Whoever sullied his hands in this.
>  
> Pure evil, personified he is,\\
  Who is to say,\\
  That what is today,\\
  Will continue to next day.
>  
> I can claim love is eternal,\\
  Isn't the receiving end lost in the funeral??\\
  I promised, whenever u call,\\
  I would honor that hour,\\
  Grave as venue, midnight as hour,\\
  Your choices & I will honor.
>
> Shall I tell the world,\\
  That I lay so late,\\
  With a form from your grave,\\
  Perhaps, your silhouette??
