## Mornings & Evenings
> Oh nature, you're a criminal, a gangsta',\\
  You are cruel to send your kin after my soul,\\
  Every day for a lil' piece of me,\\
  Tempting with the morning light,\\
  Passionately igniting the soul and heart,\\
  And before the storm of the scorching heat,\\
  Arrives the blissful, merciful wind,\\
  Silently taking away a piece of me,
>
> Sitting here in ignorance looking clairvoyantly,\\
  Into the pink eyed ghost of past,\\
  And the hauntingly mesmerizing blue eyed future,\\
  Observing the unraveling of the mystic,\\
  Enigmatic fabric of space & time being spun from\\
  The loom of fate in that old watch.
>
>> The fleeting moments of the days are hopefully lost\\
   In the ignorance of the chasing ones.
>
> Once Again,\\
  The moon awakens, night falls & from dusk to dawn,\\
  Arrives the motherly breeze with a whiff of leaves, soil and dirt,\\
  Cooling the scorched soul of the day,
  The jittering bugs & howling wolves calm this poor soul,
  Fulfilling the gaps left in the soul.
> 
> At the break of dawn,\\
  With the morning light & dew in eyes,\\
  Now, again reminded of the hellish torture,\\
  Cause you are the nature, fate and time.
