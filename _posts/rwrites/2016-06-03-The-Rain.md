## The Redeeming Rain
> I wonder when this rain will stop?\\
  It's been so cold for the longest time,\\
  Why does the rain choose to fall on me,\\
  Should I just loose myself in?
>
> The rain does not know how to stop,\\
  It continues to fall as always,\\
  While in this umbrella you gently hold me out,\\
  And I snuggle towards your warmth.
